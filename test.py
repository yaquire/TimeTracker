#This is a program that tracks how long I spend on nvim & adds it to my gmail so that I can see how long i spend programming 

#THIS IS THE LINUX VERSION 

#This secltion is the part that checks for the distro:
#It will check for the distro of which package is used; rpm, flatpak, etc.


#This checks for whether a gmail account has been added to the device

#This is the rest i have not labelled yet
